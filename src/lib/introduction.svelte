    <h1 class="text-2xl">Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
        Born in 2000 in a small town up in North Germany, I quickly found myself totally into tech.
        This fascination got me into programming as a hobby pretty early on, and eventually, I dove
        deep into the IT world. To this day, the whole field of IT keeps me super excited and throws
        new challenges at me almost every day.
